# PyNX

**nx-python** is an ecosystem for developing and running Python homebrew applications on the Nintendo Switch.
PyNX serves as the entry point to running Python apps on your Switch. 
It is a homebrew app that contains a port of the CPython interpreter and allows you to run Python applications from the Homebrew Menu.
Currently, **Python 3.5** is supported.

You can find the source of PyNX [here](https://github.com/nx-python/PyNX).
However, this package already contains a pre-build version of PyNX.


#### Terminal
I created this terminal because there wasn't any.
At this moment only the stdout shows. So no error output or anything. Ofcourse you can expect in future updates that this will be a thing.
This scene is pretty new. And the devs of PyNX do their best to support a fully functional Python for the switch.
However at this moment in time the python package is somewhat limited. I hope it is understandable.

#### `Bugs`
Please, whatever you do. Don't use touchscreen yet. You may end up with a switch that needs a restart because it freezes.
Their is already a issue open to tackle this problem. `Currently only the controllers are supported within the terminal.`

#### Installation
Copy PyNX_Terminal to your homebrew folder.
